# TVE
Twitch integrations for VTubers Extension!
# Description
TVE (Twitch Integrations for VTubers Extension!) is a software designed to run alongside VSeeFace to allow VTubers to give their streams more interactability with their models. Do you want your chat to be able to throw objects at your Avatar? Have you ever wanted your Avatar to ragdoll when a Viewer redeems a channel reward? Maybe you've wanted the ability for your viewers to even stab your Model through events, commands and rewards? All of it is possible with TVE!

This Extension was fully programmed by Nepu (Me) and will be distributed through Itch.io (If I do release it publicly, for now its all for babi Juncker)

# Current Capablities
- Throw and stab objects at/into your Vtuber Model through Channel Points!
- Advanced Post Processing to allow better rendering of your Model!
- Chat Command, polls, prediction and reply capabiltiies

# How to Use
- Make sure that VSeeFace is running in the background, and that the OSC/VMC Protocol is enabled inside of the Settings. This is so the Tracking Information can be sent to this software automatically!

- Make sure to use the same model inside of this software that you have seleceted inside of VSeeFace, to avoid any unnecessary bugs in the tracking.

- Adjust any Lighting, Camera, Post Processing settings to your tailored desire, and then you're ready to use!

# Current State
This program is currently in the Closed Early Alpha Access, so bear in mind that the program may contain bugs and glitchiness, but this software will be updated frequently until it is stable and all of the demanded features are implemented to a scale that everyone is happy with.

# Special Thanks
Although I fully programmed this myself, it could not have been done without the help of SleepyGhost and Juncker.

SleepyGhost created all of the Art, Graphics, Interfaces and Aesthetic of this software so thank her that this software doesn't look like ass anymore.

Juncker inspired the creation of this software, funded its development and came up with many of the Twitch Integration Ideas. They are amazing creators and friends who deserve the world.
